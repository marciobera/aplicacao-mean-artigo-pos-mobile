# Basic MEAN Stack App
This application was developed to compose a final post-graduate article in MBA for Application Development on Mobile Devices, from Cidade Verde College (FCV) in Maringá - Paraná (Brazil).

The content was developed using the following technologies:

<ul>
<li><b>M</b>ongoDB;</li>
<li><b>E</b>xpress.js;</li>
<li><b>A</b>ngular.js; e</li>
<li><b>N</b>ode.js.</li>
</ul>

This application was very simple, mainly the development of the Angular frontend.
All contributions are welcome! :)
